### Hi there, I'm HÃ¥kan Edling

I am a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies and work as a software engineer at [Optimizely](https://www.episerver.com). A lot of my free time goes into developing and maintaining [Piranha Cms](https://piranhacms.org), an open source CMS framework for `.NET Core` which you of course can find [here](https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core) on GitHub.

Besides programming I like to:

* Hang out with my family
* Walk the dog
* Play bass guitar
* Record, mix and produce music
